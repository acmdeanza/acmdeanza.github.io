Things to fix

[  ] if we make the size of the browser really small, the "nerds unite" clips with the bottom.
- And if it gets really big the image doesn't cover and the text breaks at the wrong area

Possible solutions
- Use em/% more so size is relative to browser
- something fixed?
- margins / padding?
