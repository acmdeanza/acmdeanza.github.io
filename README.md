DO NOT DELETE THE googlee6c9c713c8ad094b.html file!!!

Things to fix

- if we make the size of the browser really small, the "nerds unite" clips with the bottom.
- And if it gets really big the image doesn't cover and the text breaks at the wrong area

Possible solutions
- Use em/% more so size is relative to browser
- something fixed?
- margins / padding?
